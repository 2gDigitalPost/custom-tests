# Custom Tests

The code in our 'custom' directory is completely untested. This little project aims to fix that, at least partially.

Client-side testing is done with Selenium. Unit tests are coming soon (hopefully).

Obviously this project is under heavy construction. The tests that you see here are probably fairly underwhelming
(I'm still trying to figure out Tactic and how people are using it, so I don't know what to test for or how to do it
quite yet). I'll do my best to update this as often as possible, but no promises.
